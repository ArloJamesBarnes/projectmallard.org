  <title>Specification</title>

  <p>An info segment may follow a page or section title, subtitle, or
  attribute list (although it may not be between them). An info segment
  may also follow a block declaration (depends on <link xref="mep0002"/>).
  It begins with a line (possibly indented) starting with the <code>@</code>
  character. Each line starting with <code>@</code> is an informational
  element. The Mallard <code>info</code> element is implicit.</p>

  <p>If the first informational element is indented, then the outer and
  inner indent of the implicit <code>info</code> element is set to that
  indentation level. For block info sections, the first informational
  element also sets the inner indent of the containing block, as it's
  the first line after the declaration. The <code>info</code> element
  ends in the following cases:</p>

  <list>
    <item><p>A line is encountered with an indent less than the outer
    indent of the <code>info</code> element.</p></item>

    <item><p>A line is encountered with an indent equal to the outer
    indent of the <code>info</code> element that does not start with
    the <code>@</code> character.</p></item>

    <item><p>A blank line is encountered in a block info segment (but
    not for pages and sections) and the outer indent of the <code>info</code>
    element is the same as the outer indent of the containing block. This
    is a consequence of the hanlding of newlines in block elements with
    unindented child content. Blank lines do not close the <code>info</code>
    element if it is indented.</p></item>
  </list>

  <p>The <code>@</code> character must be followed by a QName. The QName
  may be followed either by a left square bracket or whitespace. If it
  is followed by a left square bracket, an attribute list is opened. After
  the attribute list or QName, there may be text content. If the element is
  a leaf element, the text is added as direct text content of the element.
  Otherwise, a Mallard <code>p</code> element is implicitly created.</p>

  <p>If the line after an informational element is indented past the outer
  indent of the info element, that line's indentation becomes the inner indent
  of the info element. Subsequent non-blank lines continue to be child
  content as long as they are indented to at least this level. Bear in
  mind that further indent may create child elements of child elements,
  and so on.</p>

  <p>If a line in the info section does not start with the <code>@</code>
  character, it is text content. If the current element is not a leaf
  element, a Mallard <code>p</code> element is implicitly created with
  the outer and inner indent set to the indentation level of the line.
  If the line is the first line after an info line and a <code>p</code>
  element was already implicitly created due to text on the same line
  as the informational element, the outer and inner indent of that
  implicit <code>p</code> element is set to the indentation level of
  the line. If the current element is a leaf element, the line is
  added to the element's text content.</p>

  <p>If a blank line is encountered in an informational leaf element,
  then it closes that element, unless it is a verbatim element with an
  inner indent greater than its outer indent. If the element is an
  indented verbatim element, the blank line is added to the content.</p>

  <p>A leaf informational element may have an inner indent equal to its
  outer indent, in which it consumes subsequent text lines (without a
  leading <code>@</code> character) until a blank line or a line with
  a smaller outer indent. A non-leaf informational element cannot have
  any child content without an extra inner indent. Note that this is
  different from the behavior of block elements.</p>
